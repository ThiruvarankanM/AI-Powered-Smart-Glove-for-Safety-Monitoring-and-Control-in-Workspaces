# AI-Powered Smart Glove for Safety Monitoring & Control in Workspaces

This project presents an intelligent safety glove system designed to protect industrial workers by identifying and alerting them to environmental and physical hazards in real time. By leveraging AI, embedded sensors, and cloud-based analytics, this glove serves as a reliable companion in high-risk work environments such as factories and construction sites.

## üìå Overview

The **AI-powered smart glove** is an integrated wearable solution developed to monitor the surrounding environment and a worker‚Äôs physical state. It is equipped with multiple sensors to detect **dangerous gas levels, high temperatures, abnormal force levels, and types of physical falls**.

The glove provides **immediate alerts** through **LEDs and vibration motors** and sends **warning emails to the worker‚Äôs family** if critical conditions are detected. Sensor data is logged every 5 seconds to a **Firebase Realtime Database** in JSON format. This data is also exported as CSV files for use in machine learning workflows, such as those implemented on Google Colab, which help classify risk levels and improve safety predictions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. The glove is worn by the worker and all sensors are connected to **NI DAQ** and **Arduino**.  
2. **LabVIEW** initializes real-time monitoring by:  
   * Reading analog values from LM35, MQ-2, and Force Sensor via DAQ  
   * Receiving MPU6050 data via Arduino over LINX to detect falls  
   * Checking thresholds using **case structures** and **OR gates**  
   * Detecting if the worker is **unconscious** using **elapsed time function**  
3. If any hazard is detected:  
   * The **vibration motor and LEDs activate immediately**  
   * An **email alert** is sent to the family with a message like:  
     *"The worker may be in danger at the workplace. Please call and check their condition."*  
4. Sensor data is sent every **5 seconds** to Firebase in JSON format using HTTP  
5. CSV files are generated regularly from the collected data for offline analysis and machine learning on Google Colab  
6. Machine learning models analyze the data to classify the risk level from **0 (safe)** to **10 (critical)**, helping improve predictive safety alerts
